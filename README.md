# Possible Pawnshop
###  Description
Possible Pawnshop utilises Renewed-Lib CreateSaleStash which allows players to sell items through an ox_inventory stash. 

The script creates a unqiue sell stash for the PlayerId(), therefore each players stash is unique to them.

Thanks to the Renewed team for the awesome export.
